\section{Introduction}

In this work, we seek to compare the neuromuscular and impedance controllers 
in a similar way as in \cref{sec:control_sim}.

Want to make comparison as objective as possible
    -Minimize experimenter influence on contrller parameter design/selection
    -Both NM and impedance control use similar procedure for generating
    parameters
    -Preferences allow user instead of experimenter to select parameters
    -Iterative learning for fine tuning instead of hand tuning as in section
    \cref{sec:preference_optimization}
