One possible reason for the increase in torso pitch variability for the
impedance controller in the disturbance case could be that the impedance
controller failed to transition to the third, ``push off'', phase of gait
significantly more often when gait was disturbed (see
\cref{fig:treadmill_exp_phase_success}). As shown in
\cref{fig:treadmill_imp_fit} if the impedance control remains in phase 2 at the
nd of gait.
