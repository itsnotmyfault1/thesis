To evaluate the potential of neuromuscular prosthesis control to improve amputee
gait robustness, we construct a simulation of an amputee walking on a powered
prosthesis and perform optimizations to identify parameters that lead to robust
locomotion over rough terrain. We then compare the performance of the proposed
control to that of impedance control and find that the proposed control improves
robustness to elevation changes and unexpected deviations from nominal walking,
suggesting that it may help amputees prevent trips and falls
(\cref{fig:distsWalked}).
