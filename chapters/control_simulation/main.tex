To evaluate the potential of neuromuscular prosthesis control to improve amputee
gait robustness, we constructed a simulation of an amputee walking on a powered
prosthesis and performed optimizations to identify parameters that lead to
robust locomotion over rough terrain. We then compared the performance of the
proposed control to that of impedance control and found that the proposed control
improves robustness to elevation changes and unexpected deviations from nominal
walking, suggesting that it may help amputees prevent trips and falls
(\cref{fig:distsWalked}).
