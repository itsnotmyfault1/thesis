\chapter{Reactive Swing Control for Trip Avoidance}\label{sec:trip_avoidance}
\graphicspath{{chapters/trip_avoidance/figures/}}

The experimental results from \cref{sec:nm_vs_imp}, in which we compared
neuromuscular and impedance control, revealed that trips during swing were one
of the most common causes for falls (\cref{tab:treadmill_exp_fall_reasons}). In
this chapter we explore two potential methods for avoiding swing trips. The
first focuses on avoidance of obstacles during gait through online learning of
classifiers that can recognize the user's obstacle avoidance intent. In the
second, we directly address the trips during normal walking that were observed
in \cref{sec:nm_vs_imp} by incorporating LIDAR distance sensor information into
the prosthesis state estimation and swing trajectory planning.
