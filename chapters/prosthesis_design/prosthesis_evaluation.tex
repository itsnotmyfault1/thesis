    fixed to a rigid mount and commanded to maintain zero net joint torque while
    the knee and ankle joints were manually oscillated (blue) by hand at
    increasingly fast rate (purple). The resulting measured torque is shown in
    the second row of axes in black.}\label{fig:pros_eval_zero_torque}
